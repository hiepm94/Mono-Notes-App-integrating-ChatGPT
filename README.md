# Mono Notes - Minimal Notetaking Mobile App integrating ChatGPT

This project is written about a Note App named Mono Notes for Android. After some research, we decided to build a Note App with simple features. After that, we want to experiment with integrating ChatGPT into the project. All of this is only for learning and researching purposes.
